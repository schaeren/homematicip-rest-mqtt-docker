### Configuration file `hmip_access.ini`

```
[AUTH]
authtoken = <your-access-token>
accesspoint = <SGTIN-of-your-access-point>

[LOGGING]
level = 30
filename = None
```

Remarks: 
1. This file is auto-gererated with the Python script `hmip_generate_auth_token` (see [homematicip-rest-api](https://github.com/hahn-th/homematicip-rest-api?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-token)).
2. the [LOGGING] section is also generated by the script, but it is ignore by `homematicip-rest-mqtt-docker` (logging is configured in `/config/logging.json` instead).
